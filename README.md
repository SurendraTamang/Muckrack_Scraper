# MuckRack Web Scraping
Scraping the [muckrack_site](https://muckrack.com) to get the 
details about the author.


In this project I tried to get the results of Auther and grabbed 
the details using simple Python script.

urls.py --> Contains the list of urs of the author and 

crawler.py --> Reads the url of crawler.py and outputs the result

Some sample data are in output folders
